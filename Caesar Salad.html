                                    <h3><u>CAESAR SALAD</u></h3>
                                    <p><b>Caesar Salad</b> is a culinary masterpiece that elegantly combines crisp romaine lettuce, garlicky croutons, Parmesan cheese, and a creamy Caesar dressing to create a salad that is both timeless and universally beloved. This iconic dish, born in Tijuana, Mexico, by chef Caesar Cardini, has become a classic staple on menus around the world.<br>

                                        At the heart of a Caesar Salad is the crisp, dark green leaves of romaine lettuce, providing a satisfying crunch and a refreshing backdrop for the other flavors. The salad is elevated by the addition of golden-brown croutons, typically made from artisanal bread, adding a delightful contrast in texture.<br>
                                        
                                        The star of the show, however, is the Caesar dressing. A luscious and tangy concoction, the dressing combines rich mayonnaise, minced garlic, anchovies, Dijon mustard, and a generous squeeze of fresh lemon juice. This creamy dressing not only coats the lettuce leaves and croutons but also infuses the salad with a savory, umami depth that makes it truly distinctive.<br>
                                        
                                        To complete the Caesar Salad experience, shavings of Parmesan cheese are generously sprinkled over the top. The sharp and nutty notes of the cheese enhance the overall complexity of flavors, providing a satisfying finishing touch to each bite.<br>
                                        
                                        Beyond its exquisite taste, Caesar Salad is celebrated for its versatility. Grilled chicken, shrimp, or even smoked salmon can be added for those seeking a heartier meal. The combination of textures, flavors, and the interplay of creamy and crunchy elements makes this salad a timeless choice for both casual lunches and more formal dining occasions.<br>
                                        
                                        Caesar Salad's enduring popularity lies in its ability to balance simplicity with sophistication, offering a culinary experience that is both comforting and indulgent. Whether enjoyed as a light lunch or a side dish at a grand feast, Caesar Salad remains a symbol of culinary excellence and continues to delight palates worldwide.</p>
